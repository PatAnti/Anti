    I am a Sheep, My life is quite simple. I wake up after sleeping on my soft patch of hay, enjoying the warmth of my fellow sheep. Afterwards I bask in the morning sun staring at the green pastures beyond “The Fence'' while I wait for the nice old human to bring food to me as well as my brothers and sisters. Who is this man? you might ask, the wise old horse says the man is a “farmer” charged with taking care of all of our needs for as long as we live. The man is said to have what is called a “name” Humans are quite silly, they give each other words to distinguish between themselves, apparently they aren't intelligent enough to recognize each other by scent or sight, such innocent creatures they are. I do wonder what is beyond “The Fence''. The wise horse says that it's all fertile pastures as far as the Eye can see, where the hay is soft and warm and where rain doesn't exist. Where many many humans tend to your every need and want. It sounds like a Magical place. The horse says that when we grow old and plump we are taken beyond the fence by the farmer, he makes sure that we are ready for the journey to the promised land. The old man is quite kind to us, when the sun becomes very very hot, he will come to each of us and strip our cumbersome wool away, and by the time the snow falls our wool is all grown again ready to keep us warm during the cold moons. The farmer always makes sure we are well, he keeps watch on us from his big barnhouse, it looks quite different to ours. Silly farmer, how comfortable he would be if he slept on warm hay like us.

Oh my, How exciting! one of our herd has been chosen to go on the great journey. The fattest of our flock has been taken to the special brown shed sitting at the far side of the Pastures. The farmer has come to herd him away to the land beyond The Fence, never have we seen an animal come back from the shed, it can only mean that they are ready to embark on their journey. I feel quite Jealous of this lucky soul, I do so wish to be chosen for the ritual.

I had never understood the human requirement for “Names” . I found the concept quite silly, yet for some reason I decided to give myself my own “name” . Perhaps I was simply bored, I heard a sound made by the Farmer while speaking to the old lady of the Barnhouse. He had recently finished milking one of the cows and was having a talk with the Barnhouse lady. He made a specific sound “Bechamel”. These humans and their unintelligible noises, I found the sound charming and so i decided to have it be my “name” how funny it is to have a name like the humans. I wonder if any of my brothers and sisters have names that would be quite fun, we could pretend to be like the humans doing all of their nonsense.

How dreadful, one of our brothers has gone insane, he bangs his head against the great fence desperately trying to bring it down. He says he is trying to escape. Does he not know that we can leave through the ritual? He seems quite thin, I've noticed he has not eaten in several days. How will he ever get to the outside if he is so thin? Only those who are fat and healthy can complete the journey. Why else would they be the ones chosen? He started bleating utter nonsense while banging on the fence “You fools! Don’t you see? There is no escape from here! We are bred to be eaten by the humans! They do not care for us, we are simply their source of Food!” Poor misguided soul, if we were to become food why would the humans keep us in such comfort? Our brother has lost his way. Some of the others have tried to help him and calm him down. Those who tried were viciously attacked by him. Truly he has gone insane. Rejoice! The farmer has heard the ruckus and come to investigate. He has seen our brother in his current state and taken him away to the shed. But why? Our brother is not ready, he will never make it to the promised land in his condition. He must have been set free to fend for himself as we never saw him return from the shed after the incident.

I have been very carefully keeping myself in good health, my weight is steadily increasing and i believe i'll soon be ready to make the great journey, Oh i do so hope that the Farmer will choose me for the ritual this moon. A few of our brothers and sisters have decided to stop eating just like our Brother did some while ago. Who could ever believe such nonsense? Needless to say the rest of our flock have shunned them as outcasts. They will never be chosen, better for the rest of us then, it gives us less competition.

Those Brothers and Sisters who have lost their way have been denounced as heathens by the rest of the flock, no longer are they allowed to sleep in our barnyard, if they refuse to commit to the rituals they will starve and freeze outside. Our flock has no place for non-believers. The wise old horse urges us to leave them be, they have made their choice. But no! We will not let them be, they scoff at our traditions, they deserve their fate.

The farmer has gathered us for this Moon’s ritual. I am very excited, I am one of the leading ones of our flock, I am in perfect health and plump enough to make the journey ahead. The farmer looks at us all to see who is the best candidate. His eyes carefully survey our flock, his eyes rest on me for a while. Could it be? He is moving towards me. Am I to be the chosen one? Oh joy! The farmer has picked me for the ritual. He leads me outside the barn, I hear the voices of my brothers and sisters congratulating me for being chosen. On our way to the Barn I see the bodies of the non-believers, they have been tied down and according to the Wise horse they are being forcefully fed. I see tears in their eyes. Do they not understand? The farmer is trying to prepare them. They should be thankful! This is proof that humans are made to care for us, even when we go against tradition they steer us back onto the path we are meant to follow. We are approaching the shed. I feel excitement mixed with a bit of sorrow, I will miss the old farmer, my flock and the wise horse. I told the old horse my “name” in case i was ever chosen so that he could remember me by it. The horse found it amusing and said he would.

We are at the shed now the farmer opens the door and leads me inside. It is cold and dark inside the shed. The farmer has closed the door and gone off to look for something. I feel slightly afraid. Why am I afraid? There is nothing to be scared of. I am going to the great pastures of the outside. The floor of the shed feels sticky on my hooves, and in the darkness I can vaguely make out a dried up red goo. How odd, Could it be part of the ritual? The farmer has returned with his cutting tool. He takes away my wool. Why would he do that? I will surely be very cold during the journey without my woolen coat. The shed is colder than before without my pelt. I hope I am released soon, I do not like it inside the shed. The farmer has left to fetch something once more, the cold and dark of the shed fills me with fear. I'm sure it will all be alright, it's probably all part of the ritual, no need to be silly. I hear the man returning, he has an odd instrument in his hand, it resembles my hooves only a bit flatter. I do not like the shed so I will close my eyes until it is time to leave. I have been chosen finally, this is a happy moment. So then… Why do I feel so afraid?

Bechamel closes his eyes.

Thump-
